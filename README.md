## About SAML2-POC

Hola! Before jumping into the technical jargon, let's look at an example.You just started working at a Simform and You have given a work email id. Once you sign in to outlook, you're allowed to access keka, lunch app & more external services that simform provides using Single Sign-On.

You click on the keka icon, some magic happens in the background, and before you know it, you're signed into Keka without ever entering any credentials! As you might have guessed, the "magic" was actually SAML in action. 

So i have took the pain out of development & explored multiple saml2 pacakages available on internet till date & choose the best to be used and created this ready to go solution by easing integration for any laravel projects.

- Light Saml
- SP based on OneLogin-toolkit
- Auth0 SDK
- OneLogin SDK
